The Sun Nuclear Data Extraction Tools are a compilation of functions that extract data from [Sun Nuclear](http://www.sunnuclear.com) application and detection system exported files into MATLAB structures and arrays, including the SNC ArcCHECK&reg; and IC Profiler&#8482; systems.  These tools are used in various applications, including [viewray_mlc](https://github.com/mwgeurts/viewray_mlc), [viewray_fielduniformity](https://github.com/mwgeurts/viewray_fielduniformity), and [viewray_radiso](https://github.com/mwgeurts/viewray_radiso).

## Installation and Use

To install the Sun Nuclear Data Extraction Tools, copy all MATLAB .m files from this repository into your MATLAB path.  If installing as a submodule into another git repository, execute `git submodule add https://github.com/mwgeurts/snc_extract`.

## Compatibility and Requirements

The Sun Nuclear Data Extraction Tools have been validated with SNC Patient version 6.2.3 and SNC Profiler version 3.3.1 using MATLAB versions 8.3 through 8.5 on Macintosh OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion) through 10.10 (Yosemite).  These tools do not require any non-standard MATLAB/Java libraries or functions.

All functions are compatible with both JVM and non-JVM (MATLAB was executed with the `-nodisplay`, `-nodesktop`, or `-noFigureWindows` flags) environments.  If a display is present, certain functions will display a progress bar while executing.

## Tools and Examples

The following subsections describe what inputs and return variables are used, and provides examples for basic operation of each tool. For more information, refer to the documentation within the source code.

### ParseSNCacm

`ParseSNCacm()` extracts data from a SNC ArcCHECK movie file (.acm) and returns the contents of the file as a MATLAB structure.  See below for a full list of the structure fields returned.  This function will display aprogress bar while it loads (unless MATLAB was executed with the `-nodisplay`, `-nodesktop`, or `-noFigureWindows` flags).

The second input parameter can either contain one or multiple files.  If multiple files are selected, the returned data is a concatenation of all measured profiles.  However, only the header data (array calibration, background, ignore flags, etc) for the last file is returned.

If a given field is not found, this function will gracefully ingore it and the returned structure will not contain the field. If the field is found but no contents were specified, the returned field will be an empty cell array.

This function has been tested with SNC Patient version 6.2.3 and .acm file rev C. Note, there are additional fields in SNC .acm files that are not currently imported by this function. Additional fields can be added using the modular `search` variable, declared within this function. Refer to the documentation within the source code for more information.

The following variables are required for proper execution:

*  path: string containing the path to the DICOM files
* names: string or cell array of strings containing the file(s) to be loaded

```

### ParseSNCprm

`ParseSNCprm()` extracts data from a SNC Profiler movie file (.prm) and returns the contents of the file as a MATLAB structure.  See below for a full list of the structure fields returned.  This function will display a progress bar while it loads (unless MATLAB was executed with the `-nodisplay`, `-nodesktop`, or `-noFigureWindows` flags).

The second input parameter can either contain one or multiple files.  If multiple files are selected, the returned data is a concatenation of all measured profiles.  However, only the header data (array calibration, background, ignore flags, etc) for the last file is returned.

If a given field is not found, this function will gracefully ingore it and the returned structure will not contain the field. If the field is found but no contents were specified, the returned field will be an empty cell array.

### ParseSNCatxt

`ParseSNCtxt()` extracts data from a SNC Profiler ASCII File Export text file and returns the data returned as a MATLAB structure. See below for a full list of the structure fields returned.  This function will display a progress bar while it loads (unless MATLAB was executed with the `-nodisplay`, `-nodesktop`, or `-noFigureWindows` flags). Where indicated, returned arrays have a length equal to the number of profiles in the text file.  If a given field is not found, this function will gracefully ingore it and the returned structure will not contain the field. If the field is found but no contents were specified, the returned field will be an empty cell array.

This function has been tested with SNC Profiler version 3.3.1. Note, there are additional fields in SNC ASCII text files that are not currently imported by this function.  Additional fields can be added using the modular `search` variable, declared within this function. Refer to the documentation within the source code for more information.

% Plot Y axis profiles
figure;
hold on;
for i = 2:length(data.ydata)
plot(data.ydata{1}, data.ydata{i} * data.cax(i-1));
end
hold off;
```

## Event Calling

These functions optionally return execution status and error information to an `Event()` function. If available in the MATLAB path, `Event()` will be called with one or two variables: the first variable is a string containing the status information, while the second is the status classification (WARN or ERROR). If the status information is only informative, the second argument is not included.  Finally, if no `Event()` function is available errors will still be thrown via the standard `error()` MATLAB function.
